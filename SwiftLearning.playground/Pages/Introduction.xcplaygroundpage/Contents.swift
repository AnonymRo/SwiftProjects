 # Introduction
 
 This is an introduction into **Swift** programming language.\
 The markup used for this title is "#" and if you want a new row of text, you have to put a backslash at the end of the row.\
\
 In `Swift`, the simplest program is printing on the screen the text "Hello World" which can be done in a single line of code:
 - Example:
 ```
 print("Hello, world!")
 ```
 */
/*:
 Declaring a constant/variable and it's type has the following syntax:
 - Example:
 ```
 let constantName: String = "This is a constant"
 var variableName: Int = 74
 ```
*/
/*:
 You can include values into strings by simply writing the value into parantheses and a backslash before:
 - Example:
 ```
 let pillows = 2
 let bedConfig = "I have \(pillows) pillows on my bed"
 */
/*:
 The difference between an **array** and a **dictionary** is that dictionaries lets us choose a "key" that identifies the item we want to add,\
 whereas arrays just add each item sequentially.
 
 [Next >](@next)
