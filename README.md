# Swift Projects

Welcome to my Swift Learning repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository is a collection of various Swift projects that Iâ€™ve developed as part of my journey to master the Swift programming language. Each project serves as both a learning exercise and a demonstration of different Swift concepts and techniques.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a practical and hands-on approach to learning Swift. By building and refining these projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of Swift and its ecosystem. Whether you're a fellow Swift enthusiast, a student, or just curious about Swift development, I hope you find these projects useful and inspiring.

## Projects

In this repository, you will find a variety of Swift projects, ranging from simple utilities to more complex applications. Feel free to explore, experiment, and learn from the code!

## 100 Days of SwiftUI

I've completed Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI course with merits. It may be a small achievement, but I'm proud of myself and I think it's important to take a moment and appreciate our journey.
